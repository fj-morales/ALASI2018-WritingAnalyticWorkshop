    "## ALASI 2018 Workshop: From features to feedback: Designing automated feedback for student writing \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Organisers: Ming Liu, Simon Knight, Shibani Antonette and Sophie Abel\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workshop Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop aims to build writing analytics capacity through developing writing analytics literacy both at this event and beyond. Workshop activities will have two foci: the technical, and the social, both targeted at provision of feedback that supports student writing. The workshop will engage participants with the Text Analytics Pipeline (TAP), and AcaWriter API to demonstrate the mapping of textual features output to rules that can be used to provide feedback to students.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop will take a participatory approach, blending workshop, tutorial, and hackathon to consider the potential of text analytics tools for supporting writing, and how through use of openly available tools and a data carpentry approach, novices to text analytics – including educators, learning technologists, and others – can be inducted into its potential. Our focus today will be on providing relevant automated feedback on different samples of student writing. The entire session will be hands-on, interacting with a text analytics system via this Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop will run using this Jupyter notebook. The [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It can support many languages and the current notebook runs in Python. You will all work with your own notebooks (using the login IDs provided by us), so you can hack and play around with code and data. The notebook contain different segments for code, and text. The current segment is a Markdown in which we are providing a narrative text. We will have code segments where we will execute Python code to do some text analysis using TAP.  \n",

    "### The Writing Analytics Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Using some basic writing analytics, *this notebook demonstrates the process through which pedagogy and analytics come together* in order to provide formative feedback to students on their writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key elements of the process are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A clearly defined learning task\n",
    "- An understanding of the students response to the task (the writing)\n",
    "- One or more hypotheses on how aspects of the learning task may be related to computationally identifiable features in the student writing\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the process, the aim is to balance what is possible with the technology (i.e. Natural Language Processing - NLP) with what is valuable in terms of student learning. This is illustrated in the following diagram:\n",

    "**Task:** You will write an argumentative essay on the ethical issues arising from our treatment of animals. You will consider what rights animals should be granted and what ethical implications arise between differentiating people from animals. Your discussion should include philosophical thinking on animal ethics.\n",

    "In this assignment, you will: \n",
    "*\tIdentify an ethical issue \n",
    "*\tLocate 4 recent articles relevant to the issue of a sufficiently high quality to support an academic discussion \n",
    "* Link your discussion to 2 philosophers from this list: Darwin, Tom Regan, Immanuel Kant, René Descartes, Thomas Aquinas, Aristotle, Peter Carruthers, Joel Feinberg, Raymond Frey, Jeremy Bentham, Peter Singer\n",

With the increasing popularity of internet-enabled hand held devices and laptop computers, there is a tendency to assume that even the socio-economically vulnerable in our society have access to technology and the skills to use online services with confidence. This is not necessarily the case. Examples of the application of technology to provide legal information and assistance include case studies, guides and virtual legal advice clinics. The 2012 Review does not address the role of courts in serving the legal needs of the community. The court system is not regarded as a part of the wider legal assistance services. This omission questions the role of the court in facilitating access to its services, including dispute resolution and trials. These services include e-access for remote communities, availability outside of business hours, interactive processes and virtual appearances. In conclusion, the essay identified uses of technology to expand the delivery of services, many of which are transferable to an online court.\"\n",

    "#txt2='Health & Lifestyle clinic: During my placement, I focused too much on asking the right questions about a patient¡¯s health rather than simply having a casual conversation with them. I realised that this made the patient feel awkward at times because there was less rapport between us. Therefore, in this placement I realised that it is important to ask patients normal questions such as how their day has been rather than just focusing on the medication/health aspect. Other REP: During a patient consultation I was observing, I had noticed that one of the patients was very rude to the optician. The optician had dealt with the situation in a firm but polite manner. She reminded the patient that as an optician she had a responsibility to provide patient care however this would be difficult if the patient would not cooperate with the optician. This made me realise that although it is important to provide good patient care, however when patients are being rude, it is vital to stand your ground. January community pharmacy placement: During this placement, I had realised the importance of building rapport with you patient. This is because I was working in a pharmacy in a small town where everyone do know each other. I found out that the pharmacist knew most of his patients. By building this close relationship, he was able to get on with all his patients and therefore provide the best patient care. In order to do this, building rapport was a key element.'\n",

From a human-centred computing perspective, the end-user’s interpretation of these visualisations is a critical challenge to design for, with empirical evidence already showing that ‘usable’ visualisations are not necessarily effective from a learning perspective. It is now widely accepted that timely, actionable feedback is essential for effective learning which can be in the form of visualisations. This means an educator’s interpretation of visualised data is essentially the construction of a narrative about student progress, we draw on the growing body of work on Data Storytelling (DS) as the inspiration for a set of enhancements that could be applied to data visualisations to improve their communicative power. We present a pilot study that explores the effectiveness of these DS elements based on educators’ responses to paper prototypes.\" \n",

    "reflectiontext=\"Throughout block 1 hospital placement, I came across a vast range of circumstances that I feel are worth reflecting on in this final global reflection. These circumstances ultimately allowed me to gain insight into the importance and role of Pharmacist’s in the hospital setting. Before reflecting upon some of these circumstances, I feel that there is a level of importance to mention that Pharmacist’s at Royal North Shore Hospital did not have as significant of an influence, role and part in the overall health outcome of a patient. In saying this, this does not mean that they were not effective in practice, but simply not to the extent to which rural Pharmacist’s were. I will describe two circumstances I came across below and then will perform a holistic reflection on both. A few days into my rural hospital placement at Armidale Hospital, during medical ward rounds, we came across an inpatient that was diagnosed with heart conditions to which he was on a number of medications. My preceptor, XXXXXX conducted an interview with this patient. Through a highly effective interview structure, he was able to identify a secondary cause to the patient’s illness. The patient had opened up and mentioned that his wife who has Alzheimer’s would have a heavy toll on him at times. My preceptor’s ability to identify this required a significant amount of reading between the lines. His next actions were then to talk to the doctor’s about introducing a medication for his depression, which could ultimately reduce the burden of his heart on his health. Having come across both the circumstances outlined above, I gained a first hand perspective at valuing the importance of hospital Pharmacist’s. I acknowledged and recognised that being a hospital Pharmacist required a variety of competencies.\"\n",
